# Process documentation
## Wherein we document our work process.

There are 2 people working on this exercise: Ore and Eden. Ore has an extensive background in front-end development, and is fairly familiar with Webpack and ES6+Babel. Eden works as a full stack web developer, and has experience in front-end development using Angular and maintains complex Node.js servers.

We studied React.js for one evening together out of curiousity, and have a fair grasp of its very basic fundamentals; however, that's as far as our experience goes as far as React, Redux, etc. goes. Ore also knows a few snippets of Express, but nothing too in-depth. These paragraphs were written before our first session together, and this file will serve as a documentation of our work together.
Note to self: rewrite the relevant parts later when Ore isn't looking at how bad at Vim I am.
